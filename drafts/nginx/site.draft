# This file describes the location information for the mjolnir application.
#
# In your server configuration file add the following:
#
#	include /path/to/this/file;
#
# Please change `location /` accordingly if the application is not on the root
# of the domain. You may write rewrites but the main index.php file will
# redirect the request to thumbs/, media/ etc on its own if the request is sent
# to the main index.php file.
#

location / {
	try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php;
}
