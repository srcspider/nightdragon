  future = changes planned but not yet implemented (ie. heads up!)

future/3.x
----------

 - bower support removed; use of bower discouraged

liquid/2.4
----------

*core*

 - new "raw" layer stack included

 - HTMLFormField_Hidden no longer can be autocompletes by default; this change
   has been made to avoid hard to spot errors occuring on POST operations with
   out redirects

 - bower support is now deprecated and scheduled for removal in 3.x

*bugs*

 - script loader block no longer appears if there are no javascripts to load

liquid/2.3
----------

*core*

 - re-included footerinclude and headinclude shorthands in ThemeView

liquid/2.2
----------

*core*

 - improved display of file permissions system

 - several new display helpers for permissions have been added to the 
   `Filesystem` class

 - when `development` in `mjolnir/base` (ie. `www.path/config`) is set to true
   the javascript loader will inject the script sources directly into the page

 - style source handler implemented

*template*

 - `README.md` updated with basic information on new backend panels

 - `bin/vendor/install` now only installs core dependencies using 
   `/composer.json` in addition the installation will run with `--prefer-dist`, 
   which is more reliable
 
 - `bin/vendor/development` now installs development dependencies 
   using `/etc/composer.json`, unlike `bin/vendor/install` this script uses 
   `--prefer-source`

*bugs*

 - file permission errors are now correctly reported on directories

 - fix'ed a bug where theme loader priority wasn't respected

liquid/2.1
----------

*core*

 - the `cfs` module now provides a File Permissions backend which checks file
   permissions to ensure permissions weren't accidentally butchered

 - backend now contains a signout button on the admin panels page

 - `satisfied` is now the correct passed state in `require.php` tests; the old
   `available` state is still supported

 - status is now available in the application admin backend; the list should
   be more user friendly and also guaranteed to reflect server status; 
   whereas the command version (which is still available) is highly prone to 
   errors such as using different CLI configuration for a lot of tests

*bugs*

 - images will now be re-orientated to guarantee compatibility with systems
   that do not read exif data before processing (eg. thumbnail systems); the 
   class `\mjolnir\base\Image` has been introduced for this purpose and may be 
   used outside of image uploads

 - fix'ed video rotation bug

 - fix'ed theme exception system

liquid/2.0
----------

*core*

 - the use of `\defined` and `\defined` is now considered bad practice and has
   been removed; its use has been replaced by the `\app\Env` class, calling the
   static methods of `\app\Env` is equivalent to calling the methods on
   `\app\Env::instance('main')`, for direct/include interoperability with
   another mjolnir application an application must support non-main environment
   execution—interoperability with non-mjolnir applications should be clean even
   when using main; note that some constants such as `VERSION` and `EXT` have
   remained

 - `PUBDIR` is now `\app\Env::key('www.path')`

 - `DOCROOT` is now `\app\Env::key('sys.path')`

 - `ETCPATH` is now `\app\Env::key('etc.path')`

 - `VDRPATH` is now `\app\Env::key('vendor.path')`

 - other paths should follow the changes above

 - the expected location for any system errors is
   `\app\Env::key('www.path').'<errorcode>'.EXT`; implementations should
   check for file existance and handle the case where the error code is not
   supported; this includes predefined template files such as 404, 500, etc

 - `mjolnir/base -> system.info` is now `mjolnir/base -> system`

 - `mjolnir/base -> system.info -> contact.email` is now
   `mjolnir/base -> system -> email`

 - `mjolnir/base -> site:title` is now `mjolnir/base -> system -> title`

 - `mjolnir/base -> site:quote` is now `mjolnir/base -> system -> quote`

 - new property `error-reporting` for adjusting error reporting level when
   the current application needs to directly interface with some garbage
   code, default -1

 - the status for upload limit check is now a failed condition, was previously
   an error condition

 - fix'ed Shell::cmd_exists not handling fail state


*template*

 - `changelog.md` is now included; changelog has been trimmed to `liquid/1.0` 
    and up

 - the main template has been reorganized slightly; `mjolnir.php` and
   `environement.php` are now correctly located in `etc/` instead of the root

 - the `order` utility will now clear the screen on non-windows OSes before
   running the specified task

 - `config.php` in `drafts/www` has been reorganized; `system.dir` is now
   `sys.path`, `private.files` is now `key.path`, `logging -> short.log` is
   now `logging -> devlogs`, `static-theme` is now `static-assets`

 - `error.php` in the public directory is now `500.php`

 - maintanence mode is now false by default; was previously on by default

 - system paths are now located at the top, followed by the development mode
   switch

 - 404 errors are no longer excluded by default

 - various comment hints in `config.php` have been shortened to the smallest
   possible explanation, for usability purposes

 - fix'ed typo in `drafts/www/downtime.php`

 - `project.private` is now `keys.draft`, while any project specific information
   such should still be placed here, some settings have been stripped out for
   usability

 - in `keys.draft` the file driver is now the default email driver for
   easier time in development (and because there is no real usable alternative
   to smtp, which requires configuration, so might as well make dev work easier)

 - in `keys.draft` the default pdo dns is now
   'mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=YOURPROJECT', instead of
   'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mjolnir', this should give better performance on
   windows machines, and is easier to debug when the `key.path` is malformed

 - the nginx configuration has been simplified to the bare minimum; should be
   usable by your grandma now

 - bin/vendor/install and bin/vendor/update are now have improved verbose output

 - cleaned up .gitignore

 - logging and error reporting includes moved to default.mjolnir

 - etc/environment.php now uses temporary globals instead of constants

 - composer.json has been moved to etc

 - mjolnir top configs for access, auth, relays, schematics and server have now
   been moved to etc instead of demo

 - config/routes is now located in etc

 - main language configuration has been moved to etc

 - the demo now uses the indexed language system instead of the key system

*bugs*

 - a cache bug with resetpwd has been fixed

liquid/1.1 (dev)
----------------

*core*

 - new instance based Lang system introduced, the system requires libraries to
   be loaded before use allowing for lower overhead and simple unnamespaced
   `$lang->idx('something')` syntax

 - imageuploader and videouploader for forms along with general purpose video
   converting (ffmpeg driver) are now available

 - improved status/require system

*template*

 - `DOCROOT/+App` is now `DOCROOT/etc`


liquid/1.0
----------

*core*

 - refactored all interfaces to reuse each other as much as possible

 - refactoring of classes to use type/trait conventions, see documentation

 - refactored theme system (now standardized and driver based)

 - refactored application system to use new foundation interface

 - refactored language system

 - refactored html & form system

 - cleaned up access system

*template*

 - drafts is not back to being outside of the application dir
