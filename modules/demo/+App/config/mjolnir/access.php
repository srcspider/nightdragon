			 * required then simply create a protocol that implements something
			 * like an access list or some other structure and pass in here as
			 * to the apropriate role.
			 *
			 * Since protocols are programatic any type of access control logic
			 * can be done. Including "has access if is member of and X happens
			 * while Y is false", which is tricky if not sometimes impossible
			 * with ACLs.
			 *
			 * Allow::relays, Allow::backend, or Ban::relays, etc can be used to
			 * create basic protocols for common access requirements.
